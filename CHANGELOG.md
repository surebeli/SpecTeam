The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **phoenix-sos Skill**: Emergency fallback to automatically parse and safely resolve Git tree merge conflicts (e.g. `<<<<<<< HEAD`) within the `.phoenix/` metadata directory.
- **Dry-run Support**: Added `--dry-run` flag to `phoenix-review` and `phoenix-align` for safe previews of AI execution plans without modifying files.
- **PhoenixTeam Node CLI**: A lightweight companion tool (`cli/`) providing `status`, `install`, `init`, and `sos` commands for zero-token local dashboarding and one-click setup.
- **VS Code Extension**: A visual dashboard (`vscode-extension/`) integrated into the IDE sidebar to view the team's divergence state (Open, Proposed, Resolved) and launch AI conflict resolution directly from the tree view.

### Changed
- **Token Optimization**: Updated `phoenix-review` to strictly prefer incremental analysis via `git diff` rather than full document reads, heavily reducing token consumption.
- Updated plugin version references to `v2.7.0`.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Language Policy Enforcement**: Enforced strict English-only policy for all skills, prompts, and git commits to resolve locale mixing issues.
- **Git Commit Hook**: Added `.githooks/commit-msg` to block commits containing CJK characters.
- **CI Validation**: Added `validate-locale` job in GitHub Actions to check for CJK characters in `SKILL.md` files and PR commit messages.
- **Bilingual Documentation**: Created `product-requirements.zh-CN.md` and `go-to-market.zh-CN.md` as dedicated Chinese translations, translating original docs to English.

### Changed
- Translated all user-facing output templates in 7 skill files (`whoami`, `align`, `update`, `push`, `parse`, `import`, `archive`) to English.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to emphasize the strict English-only requirement.
- Updated test prompt assertions to expect English output.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Mock scenarios**: 3 demos — API conflict (2-person), solo mode (1-person), three-way conflict (3-person)
- **SHARED-CONTEXT.md**: Extracted common plugin context, reducing duplication between CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md
- **Skill frontmatter enhancements**: `triggers`, `callable-by`, `short-description`, `estimated-tokens` fields for all 13 skills
- **LICENSE**: MIT license for open-source readiness
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history tracking
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Community contribution guide with skill authoring instructions and PR process

- **MCP connectors directory**: `mcp-connectors/` with index README and planned connectors roadmap
- **Error catalog**: `ERRORS.md` with standardized PX-codes (PX-E001…PX-I005) for consistent error handling across all skills
- **E2E test runner**: `tests/run-e2e.sh` with automated Git state assertions and mock workspace setup
- **i18n support**: `config.json` locale system (`en`/`zh-CN`) for language-aware output
- **Role system**: Three-tier access control (maintainer/contributor/observer) with role guard enforcement
- **Token budget**: `estimated-tokens` annotations in all 13 skill frontmatters for cost prediction
- **Skill dependency diagram**: Mermaid flowchart in README showing trigger relationships and workflow recommendations
- **Large document protection**: Context budget warning (PX-W005) for documents exceeding 50KB

### Changed
- **PHOENIXTEAM.md**: Synced version from v2.3 to v2.5
- **phoenix-parse**: Added incremental INDEX.md update guidance (section-based updates vs full rewrite)
- **CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md**: Refactored to reference SHARED-CONTEXT.md, only platform-specific differences remain

### Fixed

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-25
