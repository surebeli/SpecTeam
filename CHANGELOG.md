# Changelog

All notable changes to SpecTeam will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Validator coverage for `open` and `fully-closed` divergences**: `tests/validate-divergences.js` now accepts those modes alongside `proposed` and `resolved`. `fully-closed` additionally asserts every action-item row carries a `✅`. The four modern fixtures under `tests/fixtures/states/` are wired up in `README.md`; `legacy-pre-3.0` is documented as deliberately validator-incompatible.

### Changed
- **`docs/design/foundation-tasks.md`**: marked FT-1..FT-3 / FT-2a / FT-2b as completed and pointed forward to `phase-2-tasks.md` so fresh sessions stop re-executing the pack.

### Fixed
- **Foundation-tasks audit verification bug**: the awk range form used to count inconsistencies in `protocol-audit.md` closed on the heading line itself (because `^## ` matched both endpoints), so the assertion always returned 0. Replaced with a flag-driven awk that counts correctly.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-04-24

### Removed
- **Legacy PhoenixTeam surfaces**: removed 6 duplicate `phoenix-*` skill folders, `cli/bin/phoenix.js`, and root `PHOENIXTEAM.md`. The repo now uses `SpecTeam` / `spec-*` exclusively.
- **`mcp-connectors/` directory**: removed unimplemented Notion and Obsidian placeholders. SpecTeam ships no connectors today — `spec-import` relies on whatever fetch capability the host AI tool already provides. Connector catalog work is a future roadmap item.
- **Low-quality AI-generated images**: removed `docs/images/logo.png`, `favicon.png`, `ui_mockup.png`, and the stale `docs/design/image2-visual-prompts.md`. Replaced favicon and UI mockup with clean SVG assets.

### Changed
- **`docs/design/architecture.md`**: fully rewrote to match the current PRD and roadmap (Git-native async workflow, no Yjs/Yunxin/PostgreSQL/LangGraph stack). Added `architecture.zh-CN.md` pair.
- **CI workflow**: pointed `.github/workflows/validate.yml` at `spec-*` skills and `SPECTEAM.md`.
- **CLI**: bundled `plugin/skills/` into the published `specteam-cli` npm package so `spec install` works after `npm i -g`. Added `files` whitelist, `repository`/`homepage`/`bugs` metadata, `prepack` script, aligned version strings.
- **`spec-import` skill**: toned down MCP connector framing to reflect the absence of shipped connectors.

### Fixed
- CLI version string (`program.version('1.0.0')`) now reads from `package.json` instead of drifting from it.
- `cli/package.json` no longer declares a non-existent `main: index.js`.
- `.gitignore` tracked the old `.phoenix/` cache directory; now covers the real `.spec/last-*.json` anchors.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Dialogue Validation Fixtures**: Added transcript fixtures and validation coverage for manual prompt flows, including align propose, approve, and finalize checkpoints.
- **Windows E2E Runner**: Added a Windows-only PowerShell wrapper for fixture validation, targeted workflow tests, and repeatable smoke workspaces.

### Changed
- **SpecTeam Release Alignment**: Unified plugin, CLI, and VS Code extension release metadata under a single `3.0.0` version.
- **Alignment Workflow**: Finalized the three-phase `spec-align` flow of propose, review or approve, and lead finalize across skills, prompts, and test scenarios.
- **Validation Coverage**: Extended divergence validation to cover proposed and resolved `.spec/DIVERGENCES.md` structures and transcript-based assertions.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **spec-sos Skill**: Emergency fallback to automatically parse and safely resolve Git tree merge conflicts (e.g. `<<<<<<< HEAD`) within the `.spec/` metadata directory.
- **Dry-run Support**: Added `--dry-run` flag to `spec-review` and `spec-align` for safe previews of AI execution plans without modifying files.
- **SpecTeam Node CLI**: A lightweight companion tool (`cli/`) providing `status`, `install`, `init`, and `sos` commands for zero-token local dashboarding and one-click setup.
- **VS Code Extension**: A visual dashboard (`vscode-extension/`) integrated into the IDE sidebar to view the team's divergence state (Open, Proposed, Resolved) and launch AI conflict resolution directly from the tree view.

### Changed
- **Token Optimization**: Updated `spec-review` to strictly prefer incremental analysis via `git diff` rather than full document reads, heavily reducing token consumption.
- Updated plugin version references to `v2.7.0`.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Language Policy Enforcement**: Enforced strict English-only policy for all skills, prompts, and git commits to resolve locale mixing issues.
- **Git Commit Hook**: Added `.githooks/commit-msg` to block commits containing CJK characters.
- **CI Validation**: Added `validate-locale` job in GitHub Actions to check for CJK characters in `SKILL.md` files and PR commit messages.
- **Bilingual Documentation**: Created `product-requirements.zh-CN.md` and `go-to-market.zh-CN.md` as dedicated Chinese translations, translating original docs to English.

### Changed
- Translated all user-facing output templates in 7 skill files (`whoami`, `align`, `update`, `push`, `parse`, `import`, `archive`) to English.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to emphasize the strict English-only requirement.
- Updated test prompt assertions to expect English output.

- **i18n support**: `config.json` locale system (`en`/`zh-CN`) for language-aware output
- **Role system**: Three-tier access control (maintainer/contributor/observer) with role guard enforcement
- **Token budget**: `estimated-tokens` annotations in all 13 skill frontmatters for cost prediction
- **Skill dependency diagram**: Mermaid flowchart in README showing trigger relationships and workflow recommendations
- **Large document protection**: Context budget warning (PX-W005) for documents exceeding 50KB

### Changed
- **SPECTEAM.md**: Synced version from v2.3 to v2.5
- **spec-parse**: Added incremental INDEX.md update guidance (section-based updates vs full rewrite)
- **CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md**: Refactored to reference SHARED-CONTEXT.md, only platform-specific differences remain

### Fixed
