# SpecTeam Workflow — Shared Context

You are operating as part of the SpecTeam workflow.
SpecTeam is used consistently as the product name, protocol name, and command surface.
All SpecTeam skills share these core principles. Follow them strictly.

## Configuration

- **Config file**: If `.spec/config.json` exists, read it at skill startup. Schema:
  ```json
  {
    "locale": "en",
    "spec_dir": ".spec",
    "output_format": "structured"
  }
  ```
- **Locale**: If `locale` is `"zh-CN"`, all user-facing output uses Chinese. If `"en"` (default), use English. If config file is missing, default to `"en"`.

## Error Handling

- **Error catalog**: All errors and warnings use standardized codes from `ERRORS.md` (e.g., `PX-E001`, `PX-W003`). Always include the code prefix in output so users can search the catalog for recovery steps.
- **Error format**: `❌ [PX-E001] {message}` for fatals, `⚠️ [PX-W001] {message}` for warnings, `ℹ️ [PX-I001] {message}` for info.

## Role System

- **Roles**: COLLABORATORS.md includes a `Role` column. Three roles:
  - **maintainer**: Full access. Can modify THESIS.md North Star section, propose/approve divergences, push, archive.
  - **contributor**: Can propose/approve divergences, update/push own docs. Cannot modify THESIS North Star directly.
  - **observer**: Read-only. Can run `status`, `diff`, `suggest`, `parse`. Cannot run `init` (as founder), `push`, `align`, `archive`, `update`.
- **Role guard**: After identity guard and branch guard, read the current user's role from COLLABORATORS.md. If the skill requires a role the user doesn't have, output `❌ [PX-E007] Insufficient permissions: current role '{role}' cannot perform this action.` and stop.
- **Default role**: If COLLABORATORS.md has no Role column (legacy format), treat all members as `contributor`.

## Core Principles

- **Single source of truth**: Only maintain standardized Spec documents under `.spec/` (THESIS.md, RULES.md, SIGNALS.md, INDEX.md, etc.).
- **User source documents are READ-ONLY** — never modify files outside `.spec/`.
- **Git is the only change tracking system**: Use native `git diff`, `git log` for minimal-cost version tracking (line-level precision, zero extra overhead).
- **Collaborator identity & directory mapping**: Each collaborator has a "member code" and a corresponding directory under `.spec/design/{code}/`. Record in `.spec/COLLABORATORS.md`.
- **Identity awareness**: The current user's member code is stored **locally** in git config (`git config spec.member-code`). Run this command at the start of every skill to determine "who am I". `.spec/COLLABORATORS.md` is a **shared registry** of all collaborators — never derive current identity from it.
- **Identity guard**: If `git config spec.member-code` returns empty, **stop immediately** and output the identity-not-bound error (see platform-specific context file for exact message format). Do not proceed with the skill.
- **Pre-flight checks**: Run `git status` before all operations and display the result.
- **Divergence registry**: `DIVERGENCES.md` is the registry for divergence status and summaries. Each has a stable ID (D-001, D-002…). Written by review, read by align/push/status. Never delete resolved entries. Full decision details (per-party instruction blocks, acceptance criteria) live in `.spec/decisions/D-{N}.md`, created by align on resolution.
- **Two-phase divergence resolution (Propose → Approve)**: `align` on an `open` divergence creates a `proposed` resolution — THESIS.md is NOT updated yet. The other party must `align` the same divergence to approve/reject. THESIS.md Decision Log is only updated after approval.
- **Diff gate on push**: Run `git diff -- .spec/` before every push and show the summary. Also check DIVERGENCES.md for open/proposed items and warn accordingly.
- **Directory depth limit**: `.spec/design/` sub-structure is at most 2 levels deep.
- **Two repo modes** (set during init): Mode A (dedicated branch `spec-docs`, default) or Mode B (git submodule).
- **Branch guard** (enforced on every skill except `spec-init`): After the identity guard, run `git branch --show-current` → `{current_branch}`, then run `git config spec.main-branch` → `{main_branch}`. Handle the result as follows:
  - **`{main_branch}` is set and matches `{current_branch}`** → pass, proceed normally.
  - **`{main_branch}` is set and differs from `{current_branch}`** → stop immediately and output:
    ```
    ❌ Current branch '{current_branch}' is not the SpecTeam main branch '{main_branch}'.
    SpecTeam operations must run on the main branch to prevent .spec/ state divergence.
    Please switch to the main branch before running: git checkout {main_branch}
    ```
  - **`{main_branch}` is empty AND `.spec/` does NOT exist** → first-time init, skip the check and proceed (init will establish the binding).
  - **`{main_branch}` is empty AND `.spec/` EXISTS** → user cloned the repo but never ran `spec-init`. Auto-recover:
    1. Read `Main Branch` field from `.spec/COLLABORATORS.md`.
    2. If found → run `git config --local spec.main-branch {main_branch}` silently, then output:
       ```
       ℹ️ Automatically bound to main branch: {main_branch} (read from COLLABORATORS.md)
       ```
       Then apply the branch check with the recovered value (block if current branch differs).
    3. If `COLLABORATORS.md` has no `Main Branch` field → output the init-required error (see platform-specific context file). Stop. Do not proceed.

```

## Large Document Protection

- **Context budget**: If a single collaborator's total document size exceeds 50KB, output `⚠️ [PX-W005]` and suggest using `--focus={topic}` to narrow the analysis scope or splitting large documents.
- **Estimated tokens**: Each skill's frontmatter includes `estimated-tokens` to help predict cost. When auto-triggering sub-skills (e.g., parse), consider the cumulative token budget.

## Output Format (every skill response must follow)

1. **[Execution Log]** Command + output (include `[PX-XXXX]` codes for any errors/warnings)
2. **[Current Identity]** Who am I: {member code} (role: {role})
3. **[Diff-Aware Summary]** Grouped by member code
4. **[Result Summary]**
5. **[Key Suggestions]** (if any)
6. **[Recommended Next Skill]** — Use platform-specific command format (see platform context file)
