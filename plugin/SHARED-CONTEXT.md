# PhoenixTeam Plugin — Shared Context

You are operating as part of the PhoenixTeam Plugin, a distributed AI team document collaboration system.
All PhoenixTeam skills share these core principles. Follow them strictly.

## Configuration

- **Config file**: If `.phoenix/config.json` exists, read it at skill startup. Schema:
  ```json
  {
    "locale": "en",
    "phoenix_dir": ".phoenix",
    "output_format": "structured"
  }
  ```
- **Locale**: If `locale` is `"zh-CN"`, all user-facing output uses Chinese. If `"en"` (default), use English. If config file is missing, default to `"en"`.

## Error Handling

- **Error catalog**: All errors and warnings use standardized codes from `ERRORS.md` (e.g., `PX-E001`, `PX-W003`). Always include the code prefix in output so users can search the catalog for recovery steps.
- **Error format**: `❌ [PX-E001] {message}` for fatals, `⚠️ [PX-W001] {message}` for warnings, `ℹ️ [PX-I001] {message}` for info.

## Role System

- **Roles**: COLLABORATORS.md includes a `Role` column. Three roles:
  - **maintainer**: Full access. Can modify THESIS.md North Star section, propose/approve divergences, push, archive.
  - **contributor**: Can propose/approve divergences, update/push own docs. Cannot modify THESIS North Star directly.
  - **observer**: Read-only. Can run `status`, `diff`, `suggest`, `parse`. Cannot run `init` (as founder), `push`, `align`, `archive`, `update`.
- **Role guard**: After identity guard and branch guard, read the current user's role from COLLABORATORS.md. If the skill requires a role the user doesn't have, output `❌ [PX-E007] 权限不足：当前角色 '{role}' 无法执行此操作。` and stop.
- **Default role**: If COLLABORATORS.md has no Role column (legacy format), treat all members as `contributor`.

## Core Principles

- **Single source of truth**: Only maintain standardized Phoenix documents under `.phoenix/` (THESIS.md, RULES.md, SIGNALS.md, INDEX.md, etc.).
- **User source documents are READ-ONLY** — never modify files outside `.phoenix/`.
- **Git is the only change tracking system**: Use native `git diff`, `git log` for minimal-cost version tracking (line-level precision, zero extra overhead).
- **Collaborator identity & directory mapping**: Each collaborator has a "member code" and a corresponding directory under `.phoenix/design/{code}/`. Record in `.phoenix/COLLABORATORS.md`.
- **Identity awareness**: The current user's member code is stored **locally** in git config (`git config phoenix.member-code`). Run this command at the start of every skill to determine "who am I". `.phoenix/COLLABORATORS.md` is a **shared registry** of all collaborators — never derive current identity from it.
- **Identity guard**: If `git config phoenix.member-code` returns empty, **stop immediately** and output the identity-not-bound error (see platform-specific context file for exact message format). Do not proceed with the skill.
- **Pre-flight checks**: Run `git status` before all operations and display the result.
- **Divergence registry**: `DIVERGENCES.md` is the registry for divergence status and summaries. Each has a stable ID (D-001, D-002…). Written by review, read by align/push/status. Never delete resolved entries. Full decision details (per-party instruction blocks, acceptance criteria) live in `.phoenix/decisions/D-{N}.md`, created by align on resolution.
- **Two-phase divergence resolution (Propose → Approve)**: `align` on an `open` divergence creates a `proposed` resolution — THESIS.md is NOT updated yet. The other party must `align` the same divergence to approve/reject. THESIS.md Decision Log is only updated after approval.
- **Diff gate on push**: Run `git diff -- .phoenix/` before every push and show the summary. Also check DIVERGENCES.md for open/proposed items and warn accordingly.
- **Directory depth limit**: `.phoenix/design/` sub-structure is at most 2 levels deep.
- **Two repo modes** (set during init): Mode A (dedicated branch `phoenix-docs`, default) or Mode B (git submodule).
- **Branch guard** (enforced on every skill except `phoenix-init`): After the identity guard, run `git branch --show-current` → `{current_branch}`, then run `git config phoenix.main-branch` → `{main_branch}`. Handle the result as follows:
  - **`{main_branch}` is set and matches `{current_branch}`** → pass, proceed normally.
  - **`{main_branch}` is set and differs from `{current_branch}`** → stop immediately and output:
    ```
    ❌ 当前分支 '{current_branch}' 不是 PhoenixTeam 主分支 '{main_branch}'。
    PhoenixTeam 操作只能在主分支上执行，以防止 .phoenix/ 状态随分支分叉。
    请切换到主分支后再运行：git checkout {main_branch}
    ```
  - **`{main_branch}` is empty AND `.phoenix/` does NOT exist** → first-time init, skip the check and proceed (init will establish the binding).
  - **`{main_branch}` is empty AND `.phoenix/` EXISTS** → user cloned the repo but never ran `phoenix-init`. Auto-recover:
    1. Read `Main Branch` field from `.phoenix/COLLABORATORS.md`.
    2. If found → run `git config --local phoenix.main-branch {main_branch}` silently, then output:
       ```
       ℹ️ 已自动绑定主分支：{main_branch}（从 COLLABORATORS.md 读取）
       ```
       Then apply the branch check with the recovered value (block if current branch differs).
    3. If `COLLABORATORS.md` has no `Main Branch` field → output the init-required error (see platform-specific context file). Stop. Do not proceed.

└── archive/            # Frozen proposals
```

## Large Document Protection

- **Context budget**: If a single collaborator's total document size exceeds 50KB, output `⚠️ [PX-W005]` and suggest using `--focus={topic}` to narrow the analysis scope or splitting large documents.
- **Estimated tokens**: Each skill's frontmatter includes `estimated-tokens` to help predict cost. When auto-triggering sub-skills (e.g., parse), consider the cumulative token budget.

## Output Format (every skill response must follow)

1. **【执行日志】** Command + output (include `[PX-XXXX]` codes for any errors/warnings)
2. **【当前身份】** Who am I: {member code} (role: {role})
3. **【Diff 感知摘要】** Grouped by member code
4. **【结果摘要】**
5. **【关键建议】** (if any)
6. **【下一步推荐 Skill】** — Use platform-specific command format (see platform context file)
